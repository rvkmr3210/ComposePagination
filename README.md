# Jetpack Compose Pagination: Implementing Infinite Scrolling with Paging 3

This sample project demonstrates how to implement pagination in a Jetpack Compose app using GitHub's public APIs. The app fetches data from GitHub's users API in paginated chunks and displays the list of users. As the user scrolls through the list, more users are dynamically loaded, providing a smooth and efficient user experience.
